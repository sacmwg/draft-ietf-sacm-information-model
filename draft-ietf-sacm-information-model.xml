            <t>This document defines an information model for endpoint
              posture assessment. The scope of the information model
              is to describe the mandatory-to-implement information
              needs required to realize the assessment of an endpoint
              in a scalable and extensible way. The information model
              aims to inform the development of specific data models
              that support the endpoint posture assessment process.
              The terms "information model" and "data model" align with
              the definitions in <xref target="RFC3444"/>.</t>

            <t>The five primary activities to support this information model are:<list
                    style="numbers">
                    <t>Endpoint Identification</t>
                    <t>Endpoint Characterization</t>
                    <t>Endpoint Attribute Expression</t>
                    <t>Guidance Expression</t>
                    <t>Endpoint Evaluation Result Expression</t>
                </list></t>

            <t>These activities are aimed at the level of the technology that performs operations to
                support the collection, communication, and evaluation of endpoint information.</t>
          <t>Review of the SACM Use Case <xref target="RFC7632"/> usage scenarios
                show a common set of business process areas that are critical to understanding
                endpoint posture such that appropriate policies, security capabilities, and
                decisions can be developed and implemented.</t>
            <t>For this information model we have chosen to focus on the following business process
                    areas:<list style="symbols">
                    <t>Endpoint Management</t>
                    <t>Software Inventory Management</t>
                    <t>Hardware Inventory Management</t>  
                    <t>Configuration Management</t>
                    <t>Vulnerability Management</t>
                </list></t>
            <t>These management process areas are a way to connect the SACM use cases and building
              blocks <xref target="RFC7632"/> to the organizational needs such
                that the definition of information requirements has a clearly understood
                context. For more information, see <xref
                  target="mapping-to-sacm-use-cases"/> which maps the SACM information model to the SACM use cases.</t>

            <t>The SACM information model offers a loose coupling between providers and
                consumers of security information. A provider can relay what it observes or infers,
                without knowing which consumers will use the information, or how they will use it. A
                consumer need not know exactly which provider generated a piece of information, or
                by what method.</t>
            <t>At the same time, a consumer *can* know these things, if necessary.</t>

            <t>As things evolve, a provider can relay supplemental information. Some consumers will
                understand and benefit from the supplemental information; other consumers will not
                understand and will disregard it.</t> 

            <section title="Problem Statement">
              <!-- TODO: May need additional revision -->
                <t>SACM requires a large and broad set of mission and business processes, and to make
                the most effective use of technology, the same data must support multiple
                processes. The activities and processes described within this document tend to build off
                of each other to enable more complex characterization and assessment. In an effort
                to create an information model that serves a common set of management processes
                represented by the usage scenarios in the SACM Use Cases <xref target="RFC7632"/>, we have narrowed
                down the scope of this model to focus on the
                information needs required for endpoint
                identification, endpoint characterization, endpoint
                attribute expression, guidance expression, and
                endpoint evaluation result expression.</t>
              
                <t>Administrators can't get technology from disparate
                sources to work together; they need information to make decisions, but the information
                is not available. Everyone is collecting the same data, but storing it as different
                information. Administrators therefore need to collect data and craft their own information,
                which may not be accurate or interoperable because it's customized by each administrator, not
                shared. A standard information model enables
                flexibility in collecting, storing, and exchanging
                information despite platform differences.</t>

                <t>A way is needed to exchange
                 information that (a) has breadth, meaning the pieces
                 of the notation are useful for a
                 variety of endpoint information, and (b) has longevity, meaning that the
                 pieces of the notation will stay useful over time.</t>
              
                <t>When creating standards, it's not sufficient to go
                  from the requirements directly to the protocol;
                the standards must eliminate ambiguity in the information transported. This is
                the purpose of information models generally. The SACM problem space is about integrating
                many information sources. This information model addresses the need to integrate security
                components, support multiple data models, and provide interoperability in a way that is
                platform agnostic, scales, and works over time.</t>


                <section anchor="section-referring-to-an-endpoint" title="Referring to an Endpoint">
    
                    <t>How to refer to an endpoint is problematic. Ideally, an endpoint would have a 
                      unique identifier. These identifiers would have a one-to-one relationship with 
                      endpoints. Every observation of an endpoint, or inference about an endpoint 
                      would be labeled with its identifier.</t>
    
                    <t>However:
                        <list style="symbols">
                        <t>An external posture attribute collector typically cannot observe the unique
                          identifier directly. An external posture attribute collector should be able to 
                          report exactly what it has observed, unembellished. It should not have to 
                          *infer* which endpoint it has observed; that inference should be left to 
                          other SACM components. So, SACM cannot require that every observation include 
                          the unique endpoint identifier.</t> 
    
                        <t>Internal posture attribute collectors are not present on all endpoints. 
                          They are not present on "dumb" devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, 
                          or on Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) devices. In these cases, *no* observers have 
                          direct access to the unique endpoint identifier.</t>
    
                        <t>An endpoint identifier is generally subject to cloning, when a system image 
                          is cloned. Then, it is no longer unique.</t> 
    
                        <t>Suppose the endpoint identifier is highly
                          clone resistant -- such as a unique certificate within a hardware cryptographic 
                          module.  Even so, it is possible to replace all of the software -- for example, 
                          changing a Windows machine to a Linux machine. Is it still the same endpoint? 
                          For SACM purposes, it isn't really the same endpoint. </t>
                        </list>
                    </t>
    
                    <t>So SACM components must be able to put disparate observations together and form a 
                      picture of an endpoint -- somewhat like a detective. The SACM information model must 
                      facilitate this.</t>
                   </section>
    
                <section title="Dealing with Uncertainty">
    
                    <t>With many information models, the information is considered certain. 
                       In SACM, information is not certain.
                       Attackers may develop countermeasures to fool some SACM components.
                       Attackers may compromise some SACM components.</t>  
    
                    <t>So the model must let SACM components and humans reason with 
                      uncertainty. There are no facts, only assertions. </t>
    
                    <t>SACM components must be able to cross check
                      observations and inferences against each other.
                      They should be able to give weight if an
                      observation or inference is corroborated by more
                      than one method. Although SACM will probably not
                      prescribe *how* to do this cross checking, SACM
                      should provide the components with information
                      that can be used to determine provenance.</t> 
    
                    <t>SACM components must be able to consider the
                      reputation of the observer or inferrer. That
                      reputation should account for the method of
                      observing or inferring, the implementer of the
                      SACM component that made the observation or
                      inference, and the compliance status of the
                      endpoint on which the observation or inference
                      was made.  For example, if some observers are
                      found to be vulnerable to a Day 1 exploit,
                      observations from those observers deserve less
                      weight. The details of reputation technology may
                      be out of scope for SACM. However, again, SACM
                      should provide components with information that
                      enables them to make this determination.</t>

                  Defined in {{RFC4949}} as "a system resource that is 
                  (a) required to be protected by an information system's 
                  security policy, (b) intended to be protected by a 
                  countermeasure, or (c) required for a system's mission". 
                  In the scope of SACM, an asset can be composed of other 
                  assets. Examples of Assets include: Endpoints, Software, 
                  Guidance, or X.509 public key certificates. An asset is 
                  not necessarily owned by an organization.</t>

                <t>An endpoint is the hollow center of the model. An endpoint is an abstract ideal. 
                   Any endpoint attribute assertion that mentions an endpoint mentions it by specifying 
                   identifying attributes. Even if there is one preferred endpoint identity, that is 
                   modeled as an identity. We do not anticipate any AVP whose attribute type is "endpoint".</t>

                    a USB port on a system may be disabled to prevent information flow
                    into our out of a particular system; this provides an additional
                    layer of protection that can complement software based protections.
                    Other such assets may include access to or modification of storage
                    media, hardware key stores, microphones and cameras. Like software
                    assets, we can consider these hardware components both from the
                    perspective of (a) an asset that needs protection and (b) an asset
                    that can be compromised in some way to do harm.</t>

               <t>SACM Components, which may be Collectors, Evaluators, etc. 
                   Collectors may be internal (performed within the

          <section title="How Known">
              <t>Each attribute-value pair or triple
                 MUST be marked with how the provider knows.
                 There MUST be at least one marking.
                 The possible markings follow.
                 <list style="symbol">
                     <t>"Self" means that the endpoint furnished the information:
                        it is self-reported. "Self" does not (necessarily) mean that the
                        provider runs on the the monitored endpoint.
                        Self-reported information is generally subject to the
                        Lying Endpoint Problem. (TODO: citation)</t>
                     <t>"Authority" means that the provider got the information,
                        directly or indirectly, from an authority that assigned it. 
                        For example, the producer got an IP-MAC association 
                        from a DHCP server
                        (or was itself the DHCP server).</t>
                     <t>"Observation" means that the provider got the information
                        from observations of network traffic.
                        For example, the producer saw the source address in
                        an IP packet.</t>
                     <t>"Verification" means that the provider has verified
                        the information.
                        For example:<list style="symbols">
                            <t>The provider does IP communication with the endpoint

                       If the provider knows none through verification but it knows at least
                       one in another way, it MUST publish at least one.

                <t>ISSUE (Jim Schaad): Scope strings are interesting.
                  However does this imply a potential need to create a new DHCP item so that 
                  it can be sent out to a device for reporting back?
                  Is there such a string already?</t>
                <t>(Cliff): Scope strings are like administrative-domain in IF-MAP.
                  It would solve many problems if DHCP servers could provide this
                  string to endpoints and to observers.
                  I am not sure whether there is a standard DHCP option that
                  fills the bill or not.
                  I am not sure how easily application software can get
                  the DHCP options from the underlying OS.
                  But this is worth exploring.</t>
                <t>(Jim): We may need to look at what happens if
                  a scope identifier is either not set or not available.
                  I am thinking of the virtual network that is NATed on my machine.
                  If those VMs reported [on themselves] then the network configuring
                  systems may not know about that VM and there would not 
                  necessarily be a reasonable scope string to report for it.</t>

                    <t>An Endpoint Attribute Assertion may come from an

                       a physical inventory system. A SACM component may derive it

                    <t> For example, an attribute assertion might have these attribute-value pairs:<list>

                    <t>This asserts that an endpoint with MAC address 01:23:45:67:89:ab ran OS X 10.6.8 throughout the specified time interval. A profiler might have provided this assertion.</t>

                    <t>"Attribute" and "event" are often used fairly interchangeably. A
                       clear distinction makes the words more useful.</t>
                    <t>An *attribute* tends not to change until something causes a change. In
                       contrast, an *event* occurs at a moment in time.</t>
                    <t>For a nontechnical example, let us consider "openness" as an attribute of a door, with two values, "open" and "closed". A
                       closed door tends to stay closed until something opens it (a breeze,
                       a person, or a dog).</t>
                    <t>The door's opening or closing is an event.</t>
                    <t>Similarly, "Host firewall enabled" may be modeled as a  true/false attribute of an endpoint. 
                       Enabling or disabling the host firewall may be modeled as
                       an event. An endpoint's crashing also may be modeled as an
                       event.</t>

                    <t>Although events are not attributes, 
                       we use one kind of information element, 
                       the "Endpoint Attribute Assertion",
                       to describe both attributes and events.</t>

                            <t>For example, a hosting center may maintain a redundant set (redundancy group) of 
multi-chassis setups to provide active redundancy and load distribution 
on network paths to WAN gateways. Multi-chassis link aggregation 
groups make the chassis appear as one endpoint. 
Traditional security controls must be applied either to 
physical endpoints or the redundancy groups they compose (and 
occasionally both). Loss of redundancy is difficult to detect or 
mitigate without specific posture information about the current state of 
redundancy groups. Even if a physical endpoint (e.g. router) that is 
part of a redundancy group is replaced, the redundancy group can remain 
the same.

description: This set of bit fields is used for marking the
             Information Elements of a Data Record that serve as INDEX MIB
             objects for an indexed Columnar MIB object.  Each bit represents
             an Information Element in the Data Record with the n-th bit
             representing the n-th Information Element.  A bit set to value 1
             indicates that the corresponding Information Element is an index
             of the Columnar Object represented by the mibFieldValue.  A bit
             set to value 0 indicates that this is not the case.
                            
             If the Data Record contains more than 64 Information Elements, the
             corresponding Template SHOULD be designed such that all INDEX
             Fields are among the first 64 Information Elements, because the
             mibIndexIndicator only contains 64 bits.  If the Data Record
             contains less than 64 Information Elements, then the extra bits in
             the mibIndexIndicator for which no corresponding Information
             Element exists MUST have the value 0, and must be disregarded by
             the Collector.  This Information Element may be exported with

            <t>TODO: revise to eliminate graph references</t>

            <t>This section illustrates the proposed SACM Information Model as applied to
                SACM Usage Scenario 2.2.3, Detection of Posture Deviations <xref
                  target="RFC7632"/>. The following subsections describe the
                elements (components and elements), graph model, and operations (sample workflow)
                required to support the Detection of Posture Deviations scenario.</t>

                    <t>The Detection of Posture Deviations scenario involves multiple elements
                        interacting to accomplish the goals of the scenario. <xref target="figure-model-of-endpoint"/> illustrates those elements along with their major communication paths.</t>

            <section title="Graph Model for Detection of Posture Deviation">
                <t>The following subsections contain examples of identifiers and metadata which
                    would enable detection of posture deviation. These lists are by no means
                    exhaustive - many other types of metadata would be enumerated in a data model
                    that fully addressed this usage scenario.</t>

                <section title="Components">

                    <t>The proposed SACM Information Model contains three components, as defined in

                            <t>The Posture Attribute Information Consumer is an analytics engine
                                which absorbs information from around the network and generates a

                                rates of posture deviations.</t>

                            <t>The Control Plane is a security automation broker which receives
                                subscription requests from the analytics engine and authorizes
                                access to appropriate information from the endpoint security

                                identifier of an endpoint, which would be made available to

                                long-term. For example, when a user disables
                                required security software, an internal collector associated with
                                an endpoint security service might publish guidance violation event

                <section title="Relationships between Identifiers and Metadata">
                    <t>Interaction between multiple sets of identifiers and metadata lead to some
                        fairly common patterns, or "constellations", of metadata. For example, an
                        authenticated-session metadata constellation might include a central network
                        session with authorizations and location attached, and links to a user
                        identity, an endpoint identity, a MAC address, an IP address, and the
                        identity of the policy server that authorized the session, for the duration
                        of the network session.</t>
                    <t>These constellations may be independent of each other, or one constellation
                        may be connected to another. For example, an authenticated-session metadata
                        constellation may be created when a user connects an endpoint to the
                        network; separately, an endpoint- posture metadata constellation may be
                        created when an endpoint security system and other collectors gather
                        and publish posture information related to an endpoint. These two
                        constellations are not necessarily connected to each other, but may be
                        joined if the component publishing the authenticated-session metadata
                        constellation is able to link the network session identifier to the identity
                        identifier of the endpoint.</t>

        <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

                <t>Added many-to-many relationship between Hardware Component and Endpoint, for clarity</t>
                <t>Added many-to-many relationship between Software Component and Endpoint, for clarity</t>
                <t>Added "contains" relationship between Network Interface and Network Interface</t>
                <t>Removed relationship between Network Interface and Account. The endpoint knows the identity it used to gain network access. The PDP also knows that. But they probably do not know the account.</t>

                <t>Trusted Network Connect (TNC) is a vendor-neutral open architecture <xref
                    target="TNC-Architecture"/> and a set of open standards for network security
                    developed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). TNC standards integrate security
                    components across end user systems, servers, and network infrastructure devices
                    into an intelligent, responsive, coordinated defense. TNC standards have been
                    widely adopted by vendors and customers; the TNC endpoint assessment protocols
                    <xref target="TNC-IF-M-TLV-Binding"/><xref target="TNC-IF-TNCCS-TLV-Binding"
                    /><xref target="TNC-IF-T-Tunneled-EAP"/><xref target="TNC-IF-T-TLS"/> were
                    used as the base for the IETF NEA RFCs <xref target="RFC5792"/><xref
                        target="RFC5793"/><xref target="RFC7171"/><xref target="RFC6876"/>.</t>
                
                <t>Traditional information security architectures have separate silos for endpoint
                    security, network security, server security, physical security, etc. The TNC
                    architecture enables the integration and categorization of security telemetry
                    sources via the information model contained in its Interface for Metadata Access
                    Points (IF-MAP) <xref target="TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding"/>. IF-MAP provides a
                    query-able repository of security telemetry that may be used for storage or
                    retrieval of such data by multiple types of security systems and endpoints on a
                    vendor-neutral basis. The information model underlying the IF-MAP repository
                    covers, directly or indirectly, all of the security information types required
                    to serve SACM use-cases.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="What is TNC IF-MAP?">
                
                <t>IF-MAP provides a standard client-server protocol for MAP clients to exchange
                    security-relevant information via database server known as the Metadata Access
                    Point or MAP. The data (known as "metadata") stored in the MAP is XML data. Each
                    piece of metadata is tagged with a metadata type that indicates the meaning of
                    the metadata and identifies an XML schema for it. Due to the XML language, the
                    set of metadata types is easily extensible.</t>
                
                <t>The MAP is a graph database, not a relational database. Metadata can be
                    associated with an identifier (e.g. the email address "user@example.com") or
                    with a link between two identifiers (e.g. the link between MAC address
                    00:11:22:33:44:55 and IPv4 address 192.0.2.1) where the link defines an
                    association (for example: a relation or state) between the identifiers. These
                    links between pairs of identifiers create an ad hoc graph of relationships
                    between identifiers. The emergent structure of this graph reflects a
                    continuously evolving knowledge base of security-related metadata that is shared
                    between various providers and consumers.</t>

            <section title="What is the TNC Information Model?">
                
                <t>The TNC Information Model underlying IF-MAP relies on the graph database
                    architecture to enable a (potentially distributed) MAP service to act as a
                    shared clearinghouse for information that infrastructure devices can act upon.
                    The IF-MAP operations and metadata schema specifications (TNC IF-MAP Binding for

                    for ICS Security <xref target="TNC-IF-MAP-ICS-METADATA"/>) define an extensible
                    set of identifiers and data types.</t>
                
                <t>Each IF-MAP client may interact with the IF-MAP graph data store through three
                    fundamental types of operation requests:<list style="symbols">
                        
                        <t>Publish, which may create, modify, or delete metadata associated with one
                            or more identifiers and/or links in the graph</t>
                        
                        <t>Search, which retrieves a selected sub-graph according to a set of search
                            criteria</t>
                        
                        <t>Subscribe, which allows a client to manage a set of search commands which
                            asynchronously return selected sub-graphs when changes to that sub-graph
                            are made by other IF-MAP clients</t>

                                1.2 are synthesized by a master specification, SP800-126 revision 2

                                is a misnomer, as SCAP defines only data models. SCAP has been adopted
                                by a number of operating system and security tool vendors.</t>

        <!-- TODO: This belongs in a SACM overview or architecture document, not here. -->
                <t>The posture of an endpoint is the status of the endpoint with respect to the
                    security policies and risk models of the organization.</t>
    
                <t>A system administrator needs to be able to determine which 
                    elements of an endpoint have a security problem and which do not conform
                    the organization's security policies. The CIO needs to be able to determine whether
                    endpoints have security postures that conform to the organization's policies to
                    ensure that the organization is complying with its fiduciary and regulatory
                    responsibilities. The regulator or auditor needs to be able to assess the level of
                    due diligence being achieved by an organization to ensure that all regulations and
                    due diligence expectations are being met. The operator needs to understand which
                    assets have deviated from organizational policies so that those assets can be
                    remedied.</t>
    
                <t>Operators will focus on which endpoints are composed of specific assets with
                    problems. CIO and auditors need a characterization of how an organization is
                    performing as a whole to manage the posture of its endpoints. All of these actors
                    need deployed capabilities that implement security automation standards in the form
                    of data formats, interfaces, and protocols to be able to assess, in a timely and
                    secure fashion, all assets on all endpoints within their enterprise. This
                    information model provides a basis to identify the desirable characteristics of data
                    models to support these scenarios. Other SACM specifications, such as the SACM
                    Architecture, will describe the potential components of an interoperable system
                    solution based on the SACM information model to address the requirements for
                    scalability, timeliness, and security.</t>

            <section title="Core Principles">
                    <t>This information model is built on the following core principles:<list style="symbols">
                        <t>Collection and Evaluation are separate tasks.</t>
                        <t>Collection and Evaluation can be performed on the endpoint, at a local
                            server that communicates directly with the endpoint, or based on data
                            queried from a back end data store that does not communicate directly
                            with any endpoints.</t>
                        <t>Every entity (human or machine) that notifies, queries, or responds to
                            any guidance, collection, or evaluator must have a way of
                            identifying itself and/or presenting credentials. Authentication is a
                            key step in all of the processes, and while needed to support the
                            business processes, information needs to support authentication are not
                            highlighted in this information model. There is already a large amount
                            of existing work that defines information needs for authentication.</t>
                        <t>Policies are reflected in guidance for collection, evaluation, and
                            reporting.</t>
                        <t>Guidance will often be generated by humans or through the use of
                            transformations on existing automation data. In some cases, guidance
                            will be generated dynamically based on shared information or current
                            operational needs. As guidance is created it will be published to an
                            appropriate guidance data store allowing guidance to be managed in and
                            retrieved from convenient locations.</t>
                        <t>Operators of a continuous monitoring or security automation system will
                            need to make decisions when defining policies about what guidance to use
                            or reference. The guidance used may be directly associated with policy
                            or may be queried dynamically based on associated metadata.</t>
                        <t>Guidance can be gathered from multiple data stores. It may be retrieved
                            at the point of use or may be packaged and forwarded for later use.
                            Guidance may be retrieved in event of a collection or evaluation trigger
                            or it may be gathered ahead of time and stored locally for use/reference
                            during collection and evaluation activities.</t>

            <section title="Architecture Assumptions">
                <t>This information model will focus on WHAT information needs to be exchanged to
                    support the business process areas. The architecture document is the best place
                    to represent the HOW and the WHERE this information is used. In an effort to
                    ensure that the data models derived from this information model scale to the
                    architecture, four core architectural components need to be defined. They are
                    producers, consumers, capabilities, and repositories. These elements are defined
                    as follows:<list style="symbols">

                        <t>Producers (e.g., Evaluation Producer) collect, aggregate, and/or derive
                            information items and provide them to consumers. For this model there
                            are Collection, Evaluation, and Results Producers. There may or may not
                            be Guidance Producers.</t>

                        <t>Consumers (e.g., Collection Consumer) request and/or receive information
                            items from producers for their own use. For this model there are
                            Collection, Evaluation, and Results Consumers. There may or may not be
                            Guidance Consumers.</t>
                         <!-- Of course there are Guidance Consumers. -->

                        <t>Capabilities (e.g., Posture Evaluation Capability) take the input from
                            one or more producers and perform some function on or with that
                            information. For this model there are Collection Guidance, Collection,
                            Evaluation Guidance, Evaluation, Reporting Guidance, and Results
                            Reporting Capabilities.</t>

                        <t>Repositories (e.g., Enterprise Repository) store information items that
                            are input to or output from Capabilities, Producers, and Consumers. For
                            this model we refer to generic Enterprise and Guidance Repositories.</t>

                <t>Information that needs to be communicated by or made available to any of these
                    components will be specified in each of the business process areas.</t>
                <t>In the most trivial example, illustrated in <xref
                        target="figure-producer-consumer"/>, Consumers either request information
                    from, or are notified by, Producers.</t>

                <t>Scalable and sustainable collection, expression, and evaluation of endpoint
                    information is foundational to SACM's objectives. To secure and defend one's network
                    one must reliably determine what devices are on the network, how those devices are
                    configured from a hardware perspective, what software products are installed on
                    those devices, and how those products are configured. We need to be able to
                    determine, share, and use this information in a secure, timely, consistent, and
                    automated manner to perform endpoint posture assessments.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Problem Scope">            
                <t>The goal of this iteration of the information model is to define the
                    information needs for an organization to effectively monitor the endpoints
                    operating on their network, the software installed on those endpoints, and the
                    configuration of that software. Once we have those three business processes in
                    place, we can identify vulnerable endpoints in a very efficient manner.</t>
                <t>The four business process areas represent a large set of tasks that support
                    endpoint posture assessment. In an effort to address the most basic and

                            specific data elements and attributes that represent problems, such as

                <t>The previous sections highlighted information needs for a set of management process
                    areas that use posture assessment to achieve organizational security goals. A single

                    elements may be required for two different process areas, resulting in two different
                    requirements. In an effort to support the main idea of collect once and reuse the
                    data to support multiple processes, we try to define a singular set of information
                    elements that will support all the associated information needs.</t>

                <t>TODO: Kim to pull up relevant content into section 4 / Elements</t>
                <t>Traditionally, one would use the SACM architecture to define interfaces that required
                    information exchanges. Identified information elements would then be based on those
                    exchanges. Because the SACM architecture document is still in the personal draft
                    stage, this information model uses a different approach to the identification of
                    information elements. First it lists the four main endpoint posture assessment
                    activities. Then it identifies management process areas that use endpoint posture
                    assessment to achieve organizational security objectives. These process areas were
                    then broken down into operations that mirrored the typical workflow from the SACM
                    Use Cases draft <xref target="RFC7632"/>. These operations identify
                    architectural components and their information needs. In this section, information
                    elements derived from those information needs are mapped back to the four main
                    activities listed above.</t>

                <t>Per the liaison statement, each subsection references related work that provides a
                    basis for potential data models. Some analysis is also included for each area of
                    related work on how directly applicable the work is to the SACM efforts. In general,
                    much of the related work does not fully address the general or use case-based
                    requirements for SACM, but they do contain some parts that can be used as the basis
                    for data models that correspond to the information model elements. In these cases
                    additional work will be required by the WG to adapt the specification. In some
                    cases, existing work can largely be used in an unmodified fashion. This is also
                    indicated in the analysis. Due to time constraints, the work in this section is very
                    biased to previous work supported by the authors and does not reflect a
                    comprehensive listing. An attempt has been made where possible to reference existing
                    IETF work. Additional research and discussion is needed to include other related
                    work in standards and technology communities that could and should be listed here.
                    The authors intend to continue this work in subsequent revisions of this draft.</t>
                <t>Where possible when selecting and developing data models in support of these
                    information model elements, extension points and IANA registries SHOULD be used to
                    provide for extensibility which will allow for future data models to be

                    <t>In this context an "asset" refers to "anything that has value to an organization"

                        the current definition in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology"/>. To support
                        SACM use cases, a number of different asset types will need to be addressed. For

                            <t>The Asset Identification specification <xref target="NISTIR-7693"/> is an
                                XML-based data model that "provides the necessary constructs to uniquely
                                identify assets based on known identifiers and/or known information
                                about the assets." Asset identification plays an important role in an
                                organization's ability to quickly correlate different sets of
                                information about assets. The Asset Identification specification
                                provides the necessary constructs to uniquely identify assets based on
                                known identifiers and/or known information about the assets. Asset
                                Identification provides a relatively flat and extensible model for
                                capturing the identifying information about a one or more assets, and
                                also provides a way to represent relationships between assets.</t>
                            <t>The model is organized using an inheritance hierarchy of specialized
                                asset types/classes (see <xref target="figure-ai-class-hierarchy"/>),
                                providing for extension at any level of abstraction. For a given asset
                                type, a number of properties are defined that provide for capturing
                                identifying characteristics and the referencing of namespace qualified
                                asset identifiers, called "synthetic IDs."</t>

                                            <t>Because there is no requirement for vendors to publish
                                                their own, official CPE names, CPE necessarily requires
                                                one or more organizations for curation. This centralized
                                                curation requirement ensures that the effort has

                                            <t>Not enough primary source vendors provide platform and

                                    hotfixes), and redistributable components. SWID tags also provide
                                    for a mechanism to relate these concepts to each other. For example,
                                    installed software can be related back to the original installation
                                    media, patches can be related to the software that they patch, and
                                    software dependencies can be described for required redistributable
                                    components. SWID tags are ideally created at build-time by the
                                    software creator, publisher or licensor; are bundled with software
                                    installers; and are deployed to an endpoint during software
                                    installation.</t>
                                <t>SWID tags should be considered for two primary uses:<list
                                        style="numbers">
                                        <t>As the data format for exchanging descriptive information
                                            about software products, and</t>
                                        <t>As the source of unique identifiers for installed
                                            software.</t>
                                    </list></t>
                                <t>In addition to usage for software identification, a SWID tag can
                                    provide the necessary data needed to target guidance based on
                                    included metadata, and to support verification of installed software
                                    and software media using cryptographic hashes. This added
                                    information increases the value of using SWID tags as part of the
                                    larger security automation and continuous monitoring solution
                                    space.</t>

                                <t>The Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) <xref target="CCE"/> is an
                                    effort managed by NIST. CCE provides a unique identifier for
                                    platform-specific configuration items that facilitates fast and
                                    accurate correlation of configuration items across multiple
                                    information sources and tools. CCE does this by providing an
                                    identifier, a human readable description of the configuration
                                    control, parameters needed to implement the configuration control,
                                    various technical mechanisms that can be used to implement the
                                    configuration control, and references to documentation that describe
                                    the configuration control in more detail.</t>
                                <t>By vendor request, NIST issues new blocks of CCE identifiers. Vendors
                                    then populate the required fields and provided the details back to
                                    NIST for publication in the "CCE List", a consolidated listing of
                                    assigned CCE identifiers and associated data. Many vendors also
                                    include references to these identifiers in web pages, SCAP content,
                                    and prose configuration guides they produce.</t>
                                <t>CCE the identifier format for platform specific configuration items
                                    in SCAP and is currently adopted by a number of SCAP product
                                    vendors.</t>
                                <t>While CCE is largely supported as a crowd-sourced effort, it does
                                    rely on a central point of coordination for assignment of new CCE
                                    identifiers. This approach to assignment requires a single
                                    organization, currently NIST, to manage allocations of CCE
                                    identifiers which doesn't scale well and introduces sustainability
                                    challenges for large volumes of identifier assignment. If this
                                    approach is used going forward by SACM, a namespaced approach is
                                    recommended for identifier assignment that allows vendors to manage
                                    their own namespace of CCE identifiers. This change would require
                                    additional work to specify and implement.</t>

                                        using OVAL by creating XML instances based on the XML schema
                                        implementation of the OVAL Definitions model. The OVAL
                                        Definitions model defines a structured identifier format for
                                        each of the Definition, Test, Object, State, and Item elements.
                                        Each instantiation of these elements in OVAL XML instances are
                                        assigned a unique identifier based on the specific elements
                                        identifier syntax. These XML instances are used by tools that
                                        support OVAL to drive collection and evaluation of endpoint
                                        posture. When posture collection is performed, an OVAL Systems
                                        Characteristics XML instance is generated based on the collected
                                        posture attributes. When this collected posture is evaluated, an
                                        OVAL Result XML instance is generated that contains the results
                                        of the evaluation. In most implementations, the collection and
                                        evaluation is performed at the same time.</t>
    
                                    <t>Many of the elements in the OVAL model (i.e., Test, Object,
                                        State, Item) are abstract, requiring a platform-specific schema
                                        implementation, called a "Component Model" in OVAL. These
                                        platform schema implementations are where platform specific
                                        posture attributes are defined. For each aspect of platform
                                        posture a specialized OVAL Object, which appears in the OVAL
                                        Definitions model, provides a format for expressing what posture
                                        attribute data to collect from an endpoint through the
                                        specification of a datatype, operation, and value(s) on entities
                                        that uniquely identify a platform configuration item. For
                                        example, a hive, key, and name is used to identify a registry
                                        key on a Windows endpoint. Each specialized OVAL Object has a
                                        corresponding specialized State, which represents the posture
                                        attributes that can be evaluated, and an Item which represents
                                        the specific posture attributes that can be collected.
                                        Additionally, a specialized Test exists that allows collected
                                        Items corresponding to a CollectedObject to be evaluated against
                                        one or more specialized States of the same posture type.</t>
    
                                    <t>The OVAL language provides a generalized approach suitable for
                                        posture collection and evaluation. While this approach does
                                        provide for a degree of extensibility, there are some concerns
                                        that should be addressed in order to make OVAL a viable basis
                                        for SACM's use. These concerns include:<list style="symbols">

                                                labor intensive process. Doing so often involves
                                                researching and understanding system APIs and can be
                                                prone to issues with inconsistency within and between

                            This identification concept is necessary to allow similar configuration item
                            concepts to be comparable across platforms. For example, a configuration
                            item might be created for the minimum password length configuration control,
                            which may then have a number of different platform-specific configuration
                            settings. Without this type of identification, it will be difficult to
                            perform evaluation of expected versus actual state in a platform-neutral
                            way.</t>
                        <t>High-level configuration items tend to change much less frequently than the

                                target="IM-ELEMENTS-OTHER-IDENTIFIERS-PLATFORM-CI"/>) that might be
                            associated with them. To provide for the greatest amount of sustainability,
                            collections of configuration item identifiers are best defined by specific
                            communities of interest, while platform-specific identifiers are best
                            defined by the source vendor of the platform. Under this model, the primary
                            source vendors would map their platform-specific configuration controls to
                            the appropriate platform-independent item allowing end-user organizations to
                            make use of these relationships.</t>
                        <t>To support different communities of interest, it may be necessary to support
                            multiple methods for identification of configuration items and for
                            associating related metadata. Use of an IANA registry supporting multiple
                            configuration item identification methods would be an ideal way forward. To

                                    the gap between high-level policy expressions and low-level
                                    technical implementations. CCI allows a security requirement that is

                                    explicitly associated with the low-level security setting(s) that

                                <t>There will likely be a desire by different communities to create
                                    different collections of configuration item identifiers. This
                                    fracturing may be caused by:<list style="symbols">
                                        <t>Different requirements for levels of abstraction,</t>
                                        <t>Varying needs for timely maintenance of the collection,
                                            and</t>
                                        <t>Differing scopes of technological needs.</t>
                                    </list></t>
                                <t>Due to these and other potential needs, it will be difficult to
                                    standardize around a single collection of configuration identifiers.
                                    A workable solution will be one that is scalable and usable for a
                                    broad population of end-user organizations. An alternate approach
                                    that should be considered is the definition of data model that
                                    contains a common set of metadata attributes, perhaps supported by
                                    an extensible taxonomy, that can be assigned to platform-specific
                                    configuration items. If defined at a necessary level of granularity,
                                    it may be possible to query collections of platform-specific
                                    configuration items provided by vendors to create groupings at
                                    various levels of abstractions. By utilizing data provided by
                                    vendors, technological needs and the timeliness of information can
                                    be addressed based on customer requirements.</t>
                                <t> SACM should consider this and other approaches to satisfy the need
                                    for configuration item roll-up in a way that provides the broadest
                                    benefit, while achieving a sensible degree of scalability and
                                    sustainability.</t>

                                <t>The Asset Reporting Format (ARF) <xref target="NISTIR-7694"/> is a
                                    data model to express information about assets, and the
                                    relationships between assets and reports. It facilitates the
                                    reporting, correlating, and fusing of asset information within and
                                    between organizations. ARF is vendor and technology neutral,
                                    flexible, and suited for a wide variety of reporting
                                    applications.</t>
                                <t>There are four major sub-components of ARF:<list style="symbols">
                                        <t>Asset: The asset component element includes asset
                                            identification information for one or more assets. It simply
                                            houses assets independent of their relationships to reports.
                                            The relationship section can then link the report section to
                                            specific assets.</t>
                                        <t>Report: The report component element contains one or more
                                            asset reports. An asset report is composed of content (or a
                                            link to content) about one or more assets.</t>
                                        <t>Report-Request: The report-request component element contains
                                            the asset report requests, which can give context to asset
                                            reports captured in the report section. The report-request
                                            section simply houses asset report requests independent of
                                            the report which was subsequently generated.</t>
                                        <t>Relationship: The relationship component element links
                                            assets, reports, and report requests together with
                                            well-defined relationships. Each relationship is defined as
                                            {subject} {predicate} {object}, where {subject} is the
                                            asset, report request, or report of interest, {predicate} is
                                            the relationship type being established, and {object} is one
                                            or more assets, report requests, or reports.</t>

                                    to its flexibility. ARF supports the use of the Asset Identification
                                    specification (more in <xref target="IM-ELEMENTS-CHAR-AI"/>) to
                                    embed the representation of one or more assets as well as
                                    relationships between those assets. It also allows the inclusion of
                                    report-requests, which can provide details on what data was required
                                    for an assessment.</t>
                                <t>ARF is agnostic to the data formats of the collected posture
                                    attributes and therefore can be used within the SACM Architecture to
                                    provide Endpoint Characterization without dictating data formats for
                                    the encoding of posture attributes. The embedded Asset
                                    Identification data model (see <xref target="AI-BACKGROUND"/>) can
                                    be used to characterize one or more endpoints to allow targeting for
                                    collection, evaluation, etc. Additionally, the report-request model
                                    can dictate the type of reporting that has been requested, thereby
                                    providing context as to which endpoints the guidance applies. </t>

                                applicability statements that can drive decisions about assets, whether

                    <t>To support the collection of posture attributes, there needs to be a way for

                        collect. The same identified attributes will also need to be identified
                        post-collection to associate the actual value of that attribute pertaining to an
                        endpoint as it was configured at the time of the collection. To provide for
                        extensibility, the need exists to support a variety of possible identification
                        approaches. It is also necessary to enable vendors of software to provide a
                        listing, or catalog, of the available posture attributes to operators that can
                        be collected. Ideally, a federated approach will be used to allow organizations
                        to identify the location for a repository containing catalogs of posture
                        attributes provided by authoritative primary source vendors. By querying these
                        repositories, operators will be able to acquire the appropriate listings of
                        available posture attributes for their deployed assets. One or more posture

                                    collected posture attribute data can then be evaluated using OVAL
                                    Definitions and the results of the evaluation can be expressed as
                                    OVAL Results. While this proposal is not currently part of the OVAL
                                    Language, it may be worth considering.</t>

                                <t>The SNMP, previously introduced in <xref target="SNMP-BACKGROUND"/>,
                                    defines a protocol for managing and retrieving posture attribute
                                    data from endpoints on a network <xref target="RFC3411"/>. SNMP
                                    provides three protocol operations <xref target="RFC3416"/>
                                    (GetRequest, GetNextRequest, and GetBulkRequest) for retrieving
                                    posture attribute data defined by MIB objects. Upon successful
                                    completion of these operations, the requested posture attribute data
                                    of the endpoint will be made available to the requesting
                                    application. Given that SNMP is widely adopted by vendors, and the
                                    MIBs that define posture attribute data on an endpoint are highly
                                    extensible, it may useful to consider this protocol as a
                                    standardized mechanism for collecting posture attribute data from
                                    endpoints in an enterprise.</t>

                                    model provides an extensible framework for making assertions about

                                    Guidance written against this model consists of one or more OVAL
                                    Tests, which can be logically combined, where each OVAL Test defines
                                    what posture attributes should be collected from an endpoint (as
                                    OVAL Objects) and optionally defines the expected state of the

                                <t>A general description of XCCDF was provided in <xref
                                        target="XCCDF-BACKGROUND"/>. As noted there, an XCCDF document
                                    represents a checklist of items against which a given endpoint's
                                    state is compared and evaluated. An XCCDF Rule represents one
                                    assessed item in this checklist. A Rule contains both a prose
                                    description of the assessed item (either for presentation to the
                                    user in a tool's user interface, or for rendering into a prose
                                    checklist for human consumption) and can also contain instructions
                                    to support automated evaluation of the assessed item, if such
                                    automated assessment is possible. Automated assessment instructions
                                    can be provided either within the XCCDF Rule itself, or by providing
                                    a reference to instructions expressed in other languages, such as
                                    OVAL.</t>
                                <t>In order to support greater flexibility in XCCDF, checklists can be
                                    tailored to meet certain needs. One way to do this is to enable or
                                    disable certain rules that are appropriate or inappropriate to a
                                    given endpoint, respectively. For example, a single XCCDF checklist
                                    might contain check items to evaluate the configuration of an
                                    endpoint's operating system. An endpoint deployed in an enterprise's
                                    DMZ might need to be locked down more than a common internal
                                    endpoint, due to the greater exposure to attack. In this case, some
                                    operating system configuration requirements for the DMZ endpoint
                                    might be unnecessary for the internal endpoint. Nonetheless, most
                                    configuration requirements would probably remain applicable to both
                                    environments (providing a common baseline for configuration of the
                                    given operating system) and thus be common to the checking
                                    instructions for both types of endpoints. XCCDF supports this by
                                    allowing a single checklist to be defined, but then tailored to the
                                    needs of the assessed endpoint. In the previous example, some Rules
                                    that apply only to the DMZ endpoint would be disabled during the
                                    assessment of an internal endpoint and would not be exercised during
                                    the assessment or count towards the assessment results. To
                                    accomplish this, XCCDF uses the CPE Applicability Language. By
                                    enhancing this applicability language to support other aspects of
                                    endpoint characterization (see <xref
                                        target="CPE-APPLICABILITY-BACKGROUND"/>), XCCDF will also
                                    benefit from these enhancements.</t>
                                <t>In addition, XCCDF Rules also support parameterization, allowing
                                    customization of the expected value for a given check item. For
                                    example, the DMZ endpoint might require a password of at least 12
                                    characters, while an internal endpoint may only need 8 or more
                                    characters in its password. By employing parameterization of the
                                    XCCDF Rule, the same Rule can be used when assessing either type of
                                    endpoint, and simply be provided with a different target parameter
                                    each time to reflect the different role-based requirements. Sets of
                                    customizations can be stored within the XCCDF document itself: XCCDF
                                    Values store parameters values that can be used in tailoring, while
                                    XCCDF Profiles store sets of tailoring instructions, including
                                    selection of certain Values as parameters and the enabling and
                                    disabling of certain Rules. The tailoring capabilities supported by
                                    XCCDF allow a single XCCDF document to encapsulate configuration
                                    evaluation guidance that applies to a broad range of endpoint
                                    roles.</t>

                                    XCCDF 1.2 Rule results do not capture the actual state of the

                                    greater than or equal to 8, but it would not capture that the
                                    endpoint was, in fact, only requiring passwords of 4 or more

            <t>TODO: Write text on how the information model above
               can be realized in this kind of graph model.</t>

            <t>The graph model describes how security information is structured,
                related, and accessed. Control of operations to supply and/or access the data is
                architecturally distinct from the structuring of the data in the information model.
                Authorization may be applied by the Control Plane (as defined in the SACM
                Architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-sacm-architecture"/>) to requests for
                information from a consumer or requests for publication from a provider, and may
                also be applied by a provider to a direct request from a consumer.</t>

            <t>This architecture addresses information structure independently of the access/transport of
                that information. This separation enables scalability, customizability, and extensibility.
                Access to provide or consume information is particularly suited to publish/subscribe/query
                data transport and data access control models.</t>

            <t>This graph model is a framework that:<list style="symbols">

                    <t>Provides a structure for the defined data types to be exchanged via a variety
                        of data transport models</t>

                    <t>Knowledge is often represented with graph-based formalisms. A common

                            <t>A set of *edges*, each connecting two vertices (technically, an edge

            <section title="Identifiers">

                    <t>Each identifier is an XML element. For extensibility, schemas use

                    <t>Identifiers are unique: two different vertices cannot have equivalent

                    <t>An identifier has a type. There is a finite, but extensible, set of

                    <t>In IF-MAP, standard identifier types include IP address, MAC address,
                        identity, and overlay network. Additional identifier types will need to be

                    <t>Any number of metadata items can be attached to an identifier.</t>

                    <t>Some identifiers, especially those relating to identity, address, and
                        location, require the ability to specify an administrative domain (such as
                        AD domain, L2 broadcast domain / L3 routing domain, or geographic domain) in
                        order to differentiate between instances with the same name occurring in

            <section title="Links">

                    <t>A link can be thought of as an ordered pair of identifiers.</t>

                    <t>A metadata item is the basic unit of information, and is attached to an
                        identifier or to a link.</t>

                    <t>A given metadata item is an XML document. In IF-MAP metadata items are generally small. However, larger ones, such as YANG data models, can also fit. For
                        extensibility, the XML schemas of metadata items use xsd:anyAttribute and such.</t>

                 <t>Identifiers are like database keys. For example, there would be identifiers for addresses, identities, unique endpoint identifiers, software component identifiers, and hardware component identifiers. The inventory of software instances and hardware instances within an endpoint might be expressed using a single YANG description, as a single metadata item in the graph. Where to put Endpoint Attribute Assertions, Evaluation Results, and the like is an open question.</t>

                    <t>How provenance should be expressed is an open question. For reference, in
                        IF-MAP provenance of a metadata item is expressed within the metadata item
                        <xref target="TNC-IF-MAP-NETSEC-METADATA"/>. For example, there is a

                    <t>Anyone can define an identifier type or a metadata type, by creating an XML
                        schema (or other specification). There is no need for a central authority.
                        Some deployments may exercise administrative control over the permitted
                        identifier types and metadata types; others may leave components free
                        rein.</t>
                    
                    <t>A community of components can agree on and use new identifier and metadata
                        types, if the administrators allow it. This allows rapid innovation.
                        Intermediate software that conveys graph changes from one component to
                        another does not need changes. Components that do not understand the new
                        types do not need changes. Accordingly, a consumer normally ignores metadata
                        types and identifier types it does not understand.</t>
