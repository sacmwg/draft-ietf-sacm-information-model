        <abstract>
          <t>This document defines the Information Elements that are transported between SACM 
            components and their interconnected relationships. The primary purpose of the 
            Secure Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) Information Model is to ensure 
            the interoperability of corresponding SACM data models and addresses the use cases 
            defined by SACM. The Information Elements and corresponding types are maintained 
            as the IANA "SACM Information Elements" registry.</t>

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="INTRO">
          <t>The SACM Information Model (IM) serves multiple purposes:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>to ensure interoperability between SACM data models that are used as transport 
                encodings,</t>
              <t>to provide a standardized set of Information Elements - the SACM Vocabulary - 
                to enable the exchange of content vital to automated security posture assessment, 
                and</t>
              <t>to enable secure information sharing in a scalable and extensible fashion in 
                order to support the tasks conducted by SACM components.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          
          <t>A complete set of requirements imposed on the IM can be
            found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements"/>. The 
            SACM IM is intended to be used for standardized data exchange between SACM components 
            (data in motion). Nevertheless, the Information Elements (IE) and their relationships 
            defined in this document can be leveraged to create and align corresponding data models 
            for data at rest.</t>

          <t>The information model expresses, for example, target endpoint (TE) attributes, guidance, 
            and evaluation results. The corresponding Information Elements are consumed and produced 
            by SACM components as they carry out tasks.</t>
          
          <t>The primary tasks that this information model supports (on data, control, and management 
            plane) are:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>TE Discovery</t>
              <t>TE Characterization</t>
              <t>TE Classification</t>
              <t>Collection</t>
              <t>Evaluation</t>
              <t>Information Sharing</t>
              <t>SACM Component Discovery</t>
              <t>SACM Component Authentication</t>
              <t>SACM Component Authorization</t>
              <t>SACM Component Registration</t>
            </list>
          </t>
           <t>These tasks are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology"/>.</t>

              <t>The notation used to define the SACM Information

                the IPFIX information model syntax <xref
                  target="RFC7012"/> which is described in <xref target="information-element-specification-template"/>. 
                However, there are several examples presented throughout the document that use a simplified 
                pseudo-code to illustrate the basic structure. It should be noted that while 
                they include actual names of subjects and attributes as well as values, they 
                are not intended to influence how corresponding SACM IEs should be defined

            defined by the SACM IM is registered as a type at the IANA registry. The Integer

              Information Elements MUST NOT conflict with each other or across multiple data models. 
              In order to avoid naming conflicts, the labels of additional IEs SHOULD be prefixed 
              to avoid collisions across extensions. The prefix MUST include an organizational 
              identifier and therefore, for example, MAY be an IANA enterprise number, a (partial)

          <t>There are two basic types of IEs:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Attributes: Atomic information elements that are equivalent to name-value-pairs
				and can be components of Subjects.</t>
              <t>Subjects: Composite information elements that have a name and are made up of 
			  Attributes and/or other Subjects. Every IE that is part of a Subject can have a 
			  quantity associated with it (e.g. zero-one, none-unbounded). The content IEs of 
			  a Subject can be ordered or unordered.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
                    
          <figure title="Example instance of an attribute and subject."
            anchor="attribute-subject-example">
            <artwork>    
      Example Instance of an Attribute:            
      hostname = "arbutus"
      
      Example Instance of a Subject:
      coordinates = (
      latitude = N27.99619,
      longitude = E86.92761
      )      
            </artwork>
          </figure>
          
          <t>In general, every piece of information that enables security posture assessment or 
            further enriches the quality of the assessment process can be associated with metadata. 
            In the SACM IM, metadata is represented by specific subjects and is bundled with other 
            attributes or subjects to provide additional information about them. The IM explicitly 
            defines two kinds of metadata: 
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Metadata focusing on the data origin (the SACM component that provides the 
                information to the SACM domain)</t>
              <t>Metadata focusing on the data source (the target endpoint that is assessed)</t>
            </list>
            Metadata can also include relationships that refer to other associated IEs (or SACM 
            content in general) by using referencing labels that have to be included in the metadata 
            of the associated IE.</t>
          
          <t>Subjects can be nested and the SACM IM allows for circular or recursive nesting. The 
            association of IEs via nesting results in a tree-like structure wherein subjects compose 
            the root and intermediary nodes and attributes the leaves of the tree. This semantic 
            structure does not impose a specific structure on SACM data models regarding data in 
            motion or data repository schemata for data at rest.</t>
          
          <t>The SACM IM provides two conceptual top-level subjects that 
             are used to ensure a homogeneous structure for SACM content

    description (required): Describes the meaning of the 
                            Information Element, how it is 
                            derived, conditions for its use,

                <t>Categories are special IEs that enable to refer to multiple 
                    types of IE via just one name. Therefore, they are similar 
                    to a type-choice. A prominent example of a category is 
                    when identifying a target endpoint. In some cases, a target 
					endpoint will be identified by a set of identifying attributes
					and in other cases a target endpoint will be identified by a
					target endpoint label which is unique within a SACM domain.
					If a subject includes the targetEndpoint information element
					as one of its components, any of the category members (targetEndpointIdentifier
					or targetEndpointLabel) are valid to be used in its place.</t>

                        the names of defined Information Elements instead of character classes. The 
                        syntax for defining list and orderedList datatypes is described below, using

                <t>As defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/>, an asset is a system resource that 
                    is (a) required to be protected by an information system's security policy, 
                    (b) intended to be protected by a countermeasure, or (c) required for a 
                    system's mission.</t>  
                <t>In the scope of SACM, an asset can be composed of other assets. Examples of 
                   Assets include: Endpoints, Software, Guidance, or Identity. Furthermore, an 
                   asset is not necessarily owned by an organization.</t>

            <section title="Endpoint">
                <t>From <xref target="RFC5209"/>, an endpoint is any computing device that can 
                    be connected to a network. Such devices normally are associated with a 
                    particular link layer address before joining the network and potentially 
                    an IP address once on the network. This includes: laptops, desktops, 
                    servers, cell phones, or any device that may have an IP address.</t>
               <t>To further clarify, an endpoint is any physical or virtual device that 
                   may have a network address. Note that, network infrastructure devices 
                   (e.g. switches, routers, firewalls), which fit the definition, are also 
                   considered to be endpoints within this document.</t> 
                <t>Physical endpoints are always composites that are composed of hardware 
                   components and software components. Virtual endpoints are composed entirely 
                   of software components and rely on software components that provide 
                   functions equivalent to hardware components.</t>
                <t>The SACM architecture differentiates two essential categories of endpoints: 
                    Endpoints whose security posture is intended to be assessed (target endpoints) 
                    and endpoints that are specifically excluded from endpoint posture 
                    assessment (excluded endpoints).</t>

            <section title="Hardware Component">
                <t>Hardware components are the distinguishable physical components that compose an 
                    endpoint. The composition of an endpoint can be changed over time by adding 
                    or removing hardware components. In essence, every physical endpoint is 
                    potentially a composite of multiple hardware components, typically resulting 
                    in a hierarchical composition of hardware components. The composition of hardware 
                    components is based on interconnects provided by specific hardware types (e.g. 
                    mainboard is a hardware type that provides local busses as an interconnect). In 
                    general, a hardware component can be distinguished by its serial number.</t>
                <t>Examples of a hardware components include: motherboards, network interfaces, graphics
                cards, hard drives, etc.</t>

                    a unique license key).</t>
                <t>It should be noted that this includes both benign and harmful software packages. Examples

                <t>Ideally, every endpoint would be identified by a unique identifier present on 
                   the endpoint, but, this is complicated due to different factors such as the 
                   variety of endpoints on a network, the ability of tools to reliably access such 
                   an identifer, and the ability of tools to correlate disparate identifiers. As a 
                   result, it is necessary for an endpoint to be identified by a set of attributes 
                   that uniquely identify it on a network. The set of attributes that uniquely 
                   identify an endpoint on a network will likely vary by organization; however, there are 
                   a number of properties to consider when selecting identifying attributes as some 
                   are better suited for identification purposes than others.

                            Does it constantly change? The less likely it is for an attribute to change 
                            over time, the better it is for identifying an endpoint on a network.</t>

                            without controlled access. The less likely an attribute is to change over 
                            time, the better chance it will be usable to identify an endpoint over time.</t>

                    of attributes to identify an endpoint, is particularly burdensome. As a result, SACM 
                    supports the concept of a target endpoint label which associates an identifier (unique
                    to a SACM domain) with the set of attributes used by an organization to identify 
                    endpoints on a network. Once defined for an endpoint, the target endpoint label can be
                    used in place of the set of identifying attributes.</t>

            <section title="Timestamp Accuracy" anchor="timestamp-accuracy">
                <t>An organization will likely have different collectors deployed across the network that 
                   will be configured to collect posture attributes on varying frequencies (periodic, ad-hoc, 
                   event-driven, on endpoint, off endpoint, etc.). Some collectors will detect changes as soon 
                   as they occur whereas others will detect them at a later point during a periodic scan or 
                   when an event has triggered the collection of posture attributes. Furthermore, some changes 
                   will be detected on the endpoint and others will be observed off of the endpoint. As a result
                   of these differences, the accuracy of the timestamp associated with the collected information 
                   will vary. For example, if a collector is only running once every 12 hours, the change probably 
                   happened at some point in time prior to the scan and the timestamp is likely not accurate. Due
                   to this, it is important for system administrators to determine if the accuracy of a timestamp
                   is good enough for their intended purposes.

        <section title="Privacy Considerations" anchor="privacy-considerations">
            <t>In the IETF, there are privacy concerns with respect to endpoint 
               identity and monitoring. This is especially true when the
               activity on an endpoint can be linked to a particular person. For
               example, by correlating endpoint attributes such as usernames,
               certificates, etc. with browser activity, it may be possible to
               gain insight in to user behavior and trends beyond what is
               required to carry out endpoint posture assessments. In the hands
               of the wrong person, this information could be used to negatively
               influence a user's behavior or to plan attacks against the 
               organization's infrastructure.</t> 
            <t>As a result, SACM data models should incorporate a mechanism by
               which an organization can designate which endpoint attributes are
               considered sensitive with respect to privacy. This will allow
               SACM Components to handle endpoint attributes in a manner
               consistent with the organization's privacy policies. Furthermore, 
               organization's should put the proper mechanism in place to ensure
               endpoint attributes are protected when transmitted, stored, and
               accessed to ensure only authorized parties are granted access.</t>
           <t>It should also be noted that some of this is often mitigated by
               organizational policies that require a user of an organization's
               network to consent to some level of monitoring in return for
               access to the network and other resources. The information that
               is monitored and collected will vary by organization and further
               highlights the need for a mechanism by which an organization can
               specify what constitutes privacy sensitive information for them.</t>

        <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

                <t>Added some proposed normative text.</t>     
                <t>For provenance:
                    <list style="symbol">     
                        <t>Added a class "Method"</t>     
                        <t>Added the produced-using relationship between an AVP and a method</t>     
                        <t>Added the produced-by relationship between a Guidance and a SACM Component</t>     
                        <t>Added the hosted-by relationship between a SACM Component and an Endpoint</t>     
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>asserted-by and summarized-by have been renamed to produced-by.</t>     
                <t>"User" is now "Account".  If a user has different credentials, SACM     
                    cannot know that they belong to the same user.  But, per Kim W, many     
                    organizations do have accounts that associate credentials.</t>
                <t>The multiplicity of the based-on relationships has been corrected.</t>     
                <t>More relationships now have labels, per UML convention.</t>                
                <t>The diagram no longer has causal arrow.  They had become redundant and were 
                    nonstandard and clutter.</t> 
                <t>Renamed "credential" to "identity", following industry usage. A credential includes
                    proof, such as a key or password. A username or a distinguished name is called an
                    "identity".</t>
                <t>Removed Session, because an endpoint's network activity is not SACM's initial focus</t>
                <t>Removed Authorization, for the same reason</t>
                <t>Added many-to-many relationship between Hardware Component and Endpoint, for clarity</t>
                <t>Added many-to-many relationship between Software Component and Endpoint, for clarity</t>
                <t>Added "contains" relationship between Network Interface and Network Interface</t>
                <t>Removed relationship between Network Interface and Account. The endpoint knows the identity it used to gain network access. The PDP also knows that. But they probably do not know the account.</t>
                <t>Added relationship between Network Interface and Identity. The endpoint and the PDP will typically know the identity.</t>                
                <t>Made identity-to-account a many-to-one relationship.</t>

            <section title="Changes in Revision 02" anchor="changes-in-revision-02">
                <t>Added Section Identifying Attributes.</t>
                <t>Split the figure into Figure Model of Endpoint and Figure Information Elements.</t>
                <t>Added Figure Information Elements Take 2, proposing a triple-store model.</t>
                <t>Some editorial cleanup</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Changes in Revision 03">
                <t>Moved <xref target="changes-in-revision-01"/>, <xref target="changes-in-revision-02"/>, and Mapping to SACM Use Cases into the Appendix.  Added a reference to it in <xref target="INTRO"/></t>
                <t>Added the <xref target="structure-of-information-elements"/> section.  Provided notes for the type of information we need to add in this section.</t>
                <t>Added the <xref target="information-model-assets"/> section. Moved sections on Endpoint, Hardware Component, Software Component, Hardware Instance, and Software Instance there. Provided notes for the type of information we need to add in this section.</t>
                <t>Removed the Provenance of Information Section.  SACM is not going to solve provenance rather give organizations enough information to figure it out.</t>
                <t>Updated references to the Endpoint Security Posture Assessment: Enterprise Use Cases document to reflect that it was published as an RFC.</t>
                <t>Fixed the formatting of a few figures.</t>
                <t>Included references to <xref target="RFC3580"/> where RADIUS is mentioned.</t>
            </section>
          
            <section title="Changes in Revision 04">
              <t>Integrated the IPFIX <xref target="RFC7012"/> syntax
                into <xref target="structure-of-information-elements"/>.</t>
              <t>Converted many of the existing SACM Information
                Elements to the IPFIX syntax.</t>
              <t>Included existing IPFIX Information Elements and
                datatypes that could likely be reused for SACM in <xref
                  target="information-model-elements"/> and <xref
                    target="structure-of-information-elements"/>
                respectively.</t>
              <t>Removed the sections related to reports as described
                in https://github.com/sacmwg/draft-ietf-sacm-information-model/issues/30.</t>
              <t>Cleaned up other text throughout the document.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Changes in Revision 05">
                <t>Merged proposed changes from the I-D IM into 
                    the WG IM (https://github.com/sacmwg/draft-ietf-sacm-information-model/issues/41).</t>
                <t>Fixed some formatting warnings.</t>
                <t>Removed a duplicate IE and added a few IE datatypes
                    that were missing.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Changes in Revision 06">
                <t>Clarified that the SACM statement and content-element subjects are conceptual
                    and that they do not need to be explicitly defined in a data model as long as
                    the necessary information is provided.</t>
                <t>Updated the IPFIX syntax used to define Information Elements. There are still
                   a couple of open issues that need to be resolved.</t>
                <t>Updated some of the Information Elements contained in Section 7 to use the revised 
                    IPFIX syntax. The rest of the Information Elements will be converted in a later
                    revision.</t>
                <t>Performed various clean-up and refactoring in Sections 6 and 7. Still need to
                   go through Section 8.</t>
                <t>Removed appendices that were not referenced in the body of the draft. The text
                   from them is still available in previous revisions of this document if needed.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Changes in Revision 07">
                <t>Made various changes to the IPFIX syntax based on discussions at the IETF 96 Meeting.
                   Changes included the addition of a structure property to the IE specification template,
                   the creation of an enumeration datatype, and the
                   specification of an IE naming convention.</t>
                <t>Provided text to define Collection Guidance, Evaluation Guidance, Classification Guidance, 
                   Storage Guidance, and Evaluation Results.</t>
                <t>Included additional IEs related to software, configuration, and the vulnerability assessment
                   scenario.</t>

                <t>Performed various other editorial changes and clean-up.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Changes in Revision 09">
                <t>Added "derived", "authority", and "verified" to the collectionTaskType 
                    IE (https://github.com/sacmwg/draft-ietf-sacm-information-model/issues/18).</t>
                <t>Updated IE examples that use content-type to use statement-type
